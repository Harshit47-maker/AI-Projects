# About The Project-

This is AI Research Paper summarizer. It is an intelligent system that automatically fetches research papers from ArXiv, extracts text from PDFs, summarizes them using a transformer-based NLP model(BART). It also provides an insight of the keywords and compares the text size of original paper and summarized version.





# Features-

* Fetches research papers using the ArXiv API.
* Extracts text from text-based PDFs.
* Summarizes papers using Facebook BART model.
* Provides insight of keywords using graphs.
* Uses chunking and summarizing for long texts.
* Saves the summary to text file.



##### Note-

This summarizer currently works with text-only PDFs. More support will be added in future updates.



# Tech Stuff-



Language - Python 3.13



##### Core Libraries-



* torch, transformers - deep learning and NLP.
* KeyBert - keyword extraction.
* matplotlib - for making graphs.
* ArXiv API - fetch papers automatically.
* VS Code - source-code editor. 



# My PC specs-



* 8gb of ram.
* Windows 11.
* Intel i7-8650u laptop CPU.
* Around 10gb of storage.



# Installation-



To install the libraries mentioned above open your powershell and use this code-



pip install torch torchvision torchaudio

pip install transformers matplotlib arxiv



in your desired folder.





# Future Updates-



Some of the future updates will include -



* Interactive web interface instead of script-based system.
* Translation of the research papers and summaries into multiple languages.
* Improved keyword analysis.
* Fine tuned model for better performance in specific tasks.
* OCR for scanned.
* More research papers repository support.



# Learn-

Here are some of the courses that I took to be able to build this project-

* I took Computer Science in my junior year(Class 11th) and Senior year(Class 12th) of high school which taught me a lot about basics of python, if you didn't do not worry you can learn the basics given below.
* Automate The Boring Stuff with Python - Python Fundamentals.
* Kaggle Python Course - Python basics.
* Hugging Face HUB LLM Course - Transformer models, fine tuning, pipeline function and much more.





All of these courses are free of cost and some even offer certificates.





# Reflection-

Building this project taught me about transformer-based summarization, NLP, and integrating multiple data processing steps into a single pipeline. I learned how to combine APIs, deep learning models, and data handling to automate literature reviews. I also learned to use the available resources to their full potential as python is the only programming language I know up till now. I also became more effective at learning on my own and was able to gain my previously lost confidence in it.





# About Me-

Hi I am Harshit, if you read till here probably you are interested in knowing more about me :D. I am a recent high school graduate from Varanasi, India. I am also a Science and tech enthusiast who always love to learn more and use that knowledge somewhere. I made this project while preparing to apply to some colleges. And yes, I do not spend all of my time in my room, in fact I hate being in my room all the time. I always go outside for new adventures, meeting my friends, or for my hobbies. I also love to travel to new places and share my knowledge with everyone.





Thanks for reading :D
